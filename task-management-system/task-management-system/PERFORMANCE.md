## Frontend Optimizations

### CSS and JavaScript Minification
- CSS files are minified to reduce file size
- JavaScript files are minified to reduce file size
- Minified versions are stored with `.min` suffix

### Resource Loading
- Critical CSS is preloaded
- JavaScript files use the `defer` attribute to prevent blocking page rendering
- Images use lazy loading to defer loading of off-screen images

### Image Optimization
- Implemented lazy loading for images
- Added helper function `lazy_load_image()` to easily create lazy-loaded images
- Uses a lightweight placeholder image until the actual image is loaded

### Browser Caching
- Added appropriate cache headers for static resources
- Different cache durations based on resource type:
  - Images: 1 year
  - CSS/JS: 1 month
  - Dynamic content: No caching

## Backend Optimizations

### Output Buffering
- Implemented output buffering to improve page rendering performance
- Content is collected in a buffer and sent to the browser all at once
- HTML is minified before being sent to the browser

### Page Caching
- Simple page caching system for static or semi-static pages
- Cache files are stored in the `/cache` directory
- Cache is bypassed for logged-in users and POST requests
- Cache invalidation when content changes

### Database Query Optimization
- Reduced unnecessary database queries
- Used prepared statements for better performance and security
- Optimized JOIN operations where possible

### HTML Minification
- Removes unnecessary whitespace and comments
- Reduces HTML file size for faster transmission
- Preserves important whitespace for readability

## Server Configuration

### Apache Optimizations
- Enabled GZIP compression for text-based resources
- Set appropriate cache headers via .htaccess
- Added security headers to protect against common vulnerabilities
- Disabled directory listing for better security

### PHP Configuration
- Optimized session handling
- Implemented efficient error handling
- Used output buffering for better performance

## Monitoring and Testing

### Performance Testing
To test the performance of your site:
1. Use browser developer tools (Network tab) to measure load times
2. Check for render-blocking resources
3. Verify that lazy loading is working correctly
4. Confirm that caching is functioning as expected

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Time to First Byte (TTFB)
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Total page size
- Number of HTTP requests

## Implementation Notes

### Using Minified Resources
To use the minified CSS and JS files:
1. Update your HTML to reference `style.min.css` instead of `style.css`
2. Update your HTML to reference `validation.min.js` instead of `validation.js`

### Clearing the Cache
To clear the page cache:
1. Call `clear_page_cache()` function
2. Or manually delete files in the `/cache` directory

### Lazy Loading Images
To use lazy loading for images:
\`\`\`php
echo lazy_load_image('/path/to/image.jpg', 'Alt text', 'css-class', 800, 600);
\`\`\`

## Future Improvements
- Implement a more robust caching system
- Add image optimization on upload
- Implement critical CSS extraction
- Add service worker for offline support
- Implement HTTP/2 server push for critical resources

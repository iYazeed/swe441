## Database Indexing

### Added Indexes
The following indexes have been added to improve query performance:

#### Tasks Table
- `idx_tasks_user_id`: Index on `user_id` to speed up queries filtering by user
- `idx_tasks_status`: Index on `status` to optimize status filtering
- `idx_tasks_due_date`: Index on `due_date` to improve sorting and filtering by date
- `idx_tasks_category_id`: Index on `category_id` to optimize category filtering
- `idx_tasks_user_status`: Composite index on `user_id` and `status` for combined filtering
- `idx_tasks_user_due_date`: Composite index on `user_id` and `due_date` for combined filtering and sorting

#### Categories Table
- `idx_categories_user_id`: Index on `user_id` to speed up user-specific category queries
- `idx_categories_name`: Index on `name` to optimize name lookups and uniqueness checks

#### Notifications Table
- `idx_notifications_user_id`: Index on `user_id` to optimize user-specific notification queries
- `idx_notifications_task_id`: Index on `task_id` to speed up task-related notification queries
- `idx_notifications_type`: Index on `type` to optimize filtering by notification type
- `idx_notifications_created_at`: Index on `created_at` to improve sorting by creation date

#### Users Table
- `idx_users_username`: Index on `username` to speed up username lookups during login
- `idx_users_email`: Index on `email` to optimize email uniqueness checks during registration

### Impact
These indexes significantly improve query performance, especially for:
- Filtering tasks by user, status, and category
- Sorting tasks by due date
- Retrieving notifications for a specific user
- User authentication operations

## Query Optimization

### Optimized Queries
The following query optimizations have been implemented:

1. **Selective Column Selection**: Only selecting necessary columns instead of using `SELECT *`
2. **Optimized JOINs**: Using LEFT JOIN only when necessary and optimizing join conditions
3. **Efficient WHERE Clauses**: Structuring WHERE clauses to leverage indexes effectively
4. **Optimized ORDER BY**: Using indexed columns for sorting and optimizing sort order logic
5. **LIMIT and OFFSET**: Adding pagination support to limit result sets for large data

### Example Optimizations
- Task listing query now uses indexed columns for filtering and sorting
- Notification queries use optimized joins and selective column selection
- Authentication queries use indexed lookups for username and email

## Query Caching

A simple query caching mechanism has been implemented to reduce database load for frequently accessed data:

### Cache Implementation
- In-memory cache using PHP arrays
- Configurable time-to-live (TTL) for cached results
- Cache invalidation on data modifications
- Cache key generation based on query and parameters

### Cached Queries
The following queries are now cached:
- User categories (300 seconds TTL)
- Task statistics (60 seconds TTL)
- Task listings (30 seconds TTL)
- Notification counts (30 seconds TTL)

### Cache Invalidation
Cache is automatically invalidated when:
- A task is created, updated, or deleted
- A category is created, updated, or deleted
- A notification is marked as read
- A user updates their profile

## Bulk Operations

Bulk operations have been implemented to reduce the number of database queries:

1. **Notification Creation**: Notifications are now created in bulk using a single transaction
2. **Status Updates**: Multiple status updates are batched when possible
3. **Read Status Updates**: Marking all notifications as read is done in a single query

## Performance Monitoring

The following performance monitoring features have been added:

1. **Query Logging**: Slow queries are now logged for analysis
2. **Error Tracking**: Database errors are logged with query details for debugging
3. **Cache Hit/Miss Tracking**: Cache performance is monitored to optimize TTL values

## Future Optimizations

Planned future optimizations include:

1. **Database Connection Pooling**: Implement connection pooling for better resource utilization
2. **Query Result Pagination**: Add server-side pagination for large result sets
3. **Distributed Caching**: Move to a distributed cache like Redis for better scalability
4. **Database Sharding**: Implement sharding for very large installations
5. **Asynchronous Processing**: Move notification generation to background jobs

## Conclusion

These database optimizations have significantly improved the performance of the Task Management System, particularly for users with large numbers of tasks and notifications. The system now handles concurrent users more efficiently and provides a more responsive user experience.
